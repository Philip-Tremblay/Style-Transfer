# Style-Transfer
An excersize from the Udacity Deep Learning program I am currently working through.

The details of this convolutional neural network are documented within the Jupyter notebook.
However, in summary, this is a CNN which extracts the feature details from one image, the content image.
Then extracts the style details from the style image.
A new image is created with the features of the content image in the style of the style image.

Here is a sample of what was originally produced by Udacity:
